> ColorMind turns raw HEX codes into human insights. Explore color psychology, build harmonious palettes, stress-test accessibility, and ship design decisions with confidence.

## Highlights

- Real-time color intelligence with emotional tone, HSL/LAB metrics, and temperature cues.
- Harmony Explorer surfaces complementary, triadic, and split combinations you can apply in one click.
- Brand Strategy Coach suggests campaign hooks, industry matches, and action-driving CTAs tailored to every hue.
- Accessibility Radar visualises contrast ratios, WCAG badges, and readability previews at a glance.
- Palette Library lets you save, reapply, and export palettes as CSS variables while shareable links keep collaborators in sync.
